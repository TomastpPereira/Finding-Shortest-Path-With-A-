TO RUN THE MAP GENERATOR AND A* ALGORITHM
-----------------------------------------

1. Run file 'main.py'

2. The user will be prompted to enter 2 integers for the grid length and width (only integers will work)

3. The user will be prompted to enter the positions for different types of cells in the grid (integers only)
	- Ex. If the grid is 3x3, cells will range from 1-9

4. To finish entering cells of a certain type, the user must enter '-1'

5. Steps 3 and 4 will repeat for the three cell types and for the starting position

6. The A* Algorithm will run and print a result to the console
